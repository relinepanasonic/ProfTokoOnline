-- 0041: dashboard_summary() — add order count (for a real funnel) and
-- top ad campaigns (for "Best Campaign Performance").
--
-- No "clicks" field exists anywhere in this schema: SPOS's "Produk Diklik"
-- was never promoted to a typed column, and sales_rows.raw is empty across
-- all 472k+ existing rows (verified) — no historical row has it. The
-- funnel therefore has 3 real stages (Traffic -> In-Cart -> Orders), not 4;
-- campaign performance uses Dilihat (visitors) + Orders + Sales + Ad Cost,
-- not clicks. Adding a "clicks" column is possible going forward but can't
-- backfill history — flagged to the user, not silently faked.
